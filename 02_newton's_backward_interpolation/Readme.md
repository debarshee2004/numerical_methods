# Newton's backward interpolation

Newton's backward interpolation is a numerical method used to approximate the value of a function at a point within a set of tabulated data points. It is similar to Newton's forward interpolation but is applied in reverse order. This method is particularly useful when you have data points that are unequally spaced.

**The formula for Newton's backward interpolation is as follows:**

\[f(x) = f(x_n) + (x - x_n) * Δf(x_n) + (x - x_n)(x - x_{n-1}) * Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-1}) + ⋯ + (x - x_n)(x - x_{n-1})⋯(x - x_0) * Δ^n f(x_n, x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_0)\]

Here, \(f(x)\) is the interpolated value at the point \(x\), \(x_n\) is the nearest data point to \(x\) (which is greater than \(x\)), and \(Δf(x_n)\) represents the backward difference for the first-order difference between \(f(x_n)\) and \(f(x_{n-1})\). \(Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-1})\) represents the second-order backward difference, and so on. \(Δ^nf(x_n, x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_0)\) is the nth-order backward difference.

The algorithm for Newton's backward interpolation is as follows:

**Step 1:** Given a set of data points \((x_0, f(x_0)), (x_1, f(x_1)), \ldots, (x_n, f(x_n))\) where \(x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_n\) and the value \(x\) at which you want to interpolate.

**Step 2:** Determine \(n\), the degree of the interpolation polynomial. This is done by finding \(n\) such that \(x_n\) is the nearest data point greater than \(x\).

**Step 3:** Calculate the backward differences:
   - First-order backward difference: \(Δf(x_n) = f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1})\)
   - Second-order backward difference: \(Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-1}) = Δf(x_n) - Δf(x_{n-1})\)
   - Continue this process to calculate higher-order backward differences:
   - \(Δ³f(x_n, x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}) = Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-1}) - Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-2})\)
   - \(Δ⁴f(x_n, x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}, x_{n-3}) = Δ³f(x_n, x_{n-1}, x_{n-2}) - Δ³f(x_n, x_{n-1}, x_{n-3})\)
   - Continue this process until you have all the necessary backward differences.

**Step 4:** Use the Newton's backward interpolation formula to find the interpolated value \(f(x)\) at the point \(x\) using the backward differences:

\[f(x) = f(x_n) + (x - x_n)Δf(x_n) + (x - x_n)(x - x_{n-1})Δ²f(x_n, x_{n-1}) + ⋯ + (x - x_n)(x - x_{n-1})⋯(x - x_0)Δ^nf(x_n, x_{n-1}, \ldots, x_0)\]

This interpolated value is an approximation of the function \(f(x)\) at the desired point \(x\) based on the available data points.
