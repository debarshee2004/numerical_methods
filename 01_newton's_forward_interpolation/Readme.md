# Newton's Forward Interpolation

Newton's Forward Interpolation is a numerical method for constructing an interpolating polynomial for a set of data points. It's a way to approximate values between data points by using a polynomial that passes through those points. This method is particularly useful when you have equidistant data points, meaning the x-values are equally spaced.

The formula for Newton's Forward Interpolation is as follows:

**Interpolating Polynomial (P(x)):**

P(x) = f(x0) + (x - x0) * Δf0 + (x - x0)(x - x1) * Δ²f0/2! + ... + (x - x0)(x - x1)...(x - xn-1) * Δnf0/n!

Where:
- P(x) is the interpolating polynomial.
- f(xi) represents the function values at the data points.
- xi is the given data point.
- Δf0 = f(x1) - f(x0), Δf1 = f(x2) - f(x1), Δf2 = f(x3) - f(x2), and so on, are the finite differences.
- n is the number of data points, and Δnf0/n! represents the nth finite difference divided by n factorial.

Now, let's describe the algorithm step by step:

**Step 1:** Collect your data points, which should be equidistantly spaced (x0, x1, x2, ..., xn) along with their corresponding function values (f(x0), f(x1), f(x2), ..., f(xn)).

**Step 2:** Calculate the finite differences:

- Δf0 = f(x1) - f(x0)
- Δf1 = f(x2) - f(x1)
- Δf2 = f(x3) - f(x2)
- Continue this process to calculate Δf3, Δf4, and so on.

**Step 3:** Construct the interpolating polynomial:

- P(x) = f(x0) + (x - x0) * Δf0 + (x - x0)(x - x1) * Δ²f0/2! + ... + (x - x0)(x - x1)...(x - xn-1) * Δnf0/n!

**Step 4:** Simplify the polynomial and compute values at the desired points.

- Plug in the value of x where you want to interpolate into the polynomial P(x) to get the approximate interpolated value.

Newton's Forward Interpolation is a simple and effective method for interpolating values between data points when the data points are equally spaced. The accuracy of the interpolation depends on the number of data points used and how closely the function being interpolated resembles a polynomial within the given interval.
