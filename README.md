## Overview

Numerical methods play a crucial role in solving problems where exact solutions are either impossible or impractical to obtain. This repository contains a collection of commonly used numerical methods, each implemented in C or C++, along with detailed explanations and examples. The methods covered in this repository include:

- **Root Finding**: Methods for finding roots of equations, such as the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and secant method.

- **Linear Algebra**: Techniques for solving linear systems, such as Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition, and iterative methods like Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel.

- **Interpolation and Approximation**: Algorithms for estimating data points between known values, including Lagrange interpolation and least squares approximation.

- **Numerical Integration**: Approaches for approximating definite integrals, like the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.

- **Differential Equations**: Methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Euler method and the finite difference method.

- **Optimization**: Techniques for finding optimal solutions to problems, including gradient descent and the simplex method.

This repository is organized into directories, with each directory containing the source code, explanations, and example usage for a specific numerical method. You can explore the methods you're interested in by navigating to their respective directories.
