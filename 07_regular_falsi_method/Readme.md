# Regular Falsi Method

The Regular Falsi method, also known as the False Position method or the Linear Interpolation method, is a numerical technique used for finding the roots of a continuous function within a specified interval. It is an iterative process that refines the estimate of the root in each iteration. The method is particularly useful when the function is continuous and changes sign within the given interval.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Regular Falsi method:

1. **Initial Interval Selection:**
   - Choose an initial interval [a, b] where the function changes sign (i.e., f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs). This ensures that there is at least one root within the interval.

2. **Iteration:**
   - In each iteration, calculate the next approximation, \( c \), of the root using linear interpolation. The formula for \( c \) is given by:
     \[ c = a - \frac{f(a) \cdot (b - a)}{f(b) - f(a)} \]

3. **Evaluate the Function:**
   - Calculate \( f(c) \), the function value at the new approximation \( c \).

4. **Update the Interval:**
   - Update the interval [a, b] based on the sign of \( f(c) \).
     - If \( f(c) \) has the same sign as \( f(a) \), update the interval to [c, b].
     - If \( f(c) \) has the same sign as \( f(b) \), update the interval to [a, c].

5. **Convergence Criteria:**
   - Check for convergence based on some predefined criteria. Common criteria include a specified tolerance level or a maximum number of iterations.

6. **Repeat:**
   - Repeat steps 2-5 until the convergence criteria are met.

The Regular Falsi method combines the advantages of the Bisection method's guaranteed convergence with the efficiency of the Secant method's faster convergence. However, it may suffer from slow convergence if the initial interval is not chosen wisely or if the function has a nearly horizontal slope in the vicinity of the root.

Despite its limitations, the Regular Falsi method is a simple and effective approach for finding roots of a real-valued function within a specified interval. It is widely used in numerical analysis and optimization problems.
