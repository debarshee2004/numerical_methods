# Lagrange's Interpolation

Lagrange's Interpolation is another numerical method for constructing an interpolating polynomial for a set of data points. Like Newton's Forward Interpolation, Lagrange's method is used to approximate values between given data points by constructing a polynomial that passes through those points. The key advantage of Lagrange's Interpolation is its simplicity and ease of implementation.

The formula for Lagrange's Interpolation Polynomial is given by:

**Interpolating Polynomial (P(x)):**

\[ P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f(x_i) \cdot \prod_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j} \]

Where:
- \( P(x) \) is the interpolating polynomial.
- \( f(x_i) \) represents the function values at the data points.
- \( x_i \) is the given data point.

Now, let's describe the algorithm step by step:

**Step 1:** Collect your data points, which are represented by pairs \((x_0, f(x_0)), (x_1, f(x_1)), \ldots, (x_n, f(x_n))\).

**Step 2:** Construct the interpolating polynomial using the Lagrange form:

\[ P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} f(x_i) \cdot \prod_{j=0, j \neq i}^{n} \frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j} \]

**Step 3:** Simplify the polynomial and compute values at the desired points.

- Plug in the value of \( x \) where you want to interpolate into the polynomial \( P(x) \) to get the approximate interpolated value.

Lagrange's Interpolation provides an alternative method to Newton's Forward Interpolation and is particularly convenient for its straightforward formulation. It allows for easy computation of the interpolating polynomial without the need for calculating finite differences. However, it's essential to note that the efficiency of Lagrange's method can decrease for large datasets due to the increasing number of terms in the polynomial.
